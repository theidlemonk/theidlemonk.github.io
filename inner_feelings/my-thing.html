                <p>Per out brief discussion earlier, I do want you to give me a chance to show you how I can be the person you want me to be. </p>
                <p>You are trying to change your mind, and I would rather have you to let me be a better man one last time. If things still don't work out like the way you want, slap these words on my face and tell me 'I told you you suck.'</p>
                <p>You are a very beautiful woman and I love you for that. I'm sorry I am so hard to love but I will do my best to avoid making you angry. But like its written, 'to err is human'; Let me know in such cases and I will stop. All I ask be subtle, or when the feeling of insult comes about, things get more inhuman.</p>
                <p>I understand this dont change the past, but I want us for the future. </p>
