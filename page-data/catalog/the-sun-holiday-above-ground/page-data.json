Our experience in designing and manufacturing superior quality wooden above-ground pools provides you with the widest range of shapes and sizes to meet your individual needs.</p>\n<h2>Sun Holiday Above Ground Pool Specifications</h2>\n<blockquote>\n<h2>Pressure Treated Wood Sidewalls</h2>\n<p>A Sun Holiday Pool is constructed with three quarter inch pressure treated wood sidewalls.The wood is impregnated with preservatives to resist decay and termites - even when in direct contact with the ground. Lifetime Warranty to the original consumer purchaser (See Warranty Certificate). Wood sidewalls act as a natural insulator which makes the temperature of the pool water warmer than in pools constructed of other materials.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<h2>Bracing System</h2>\n<p>A Sun Holiday Pool is braced every two feet with alternating pressure treated four inch x four inch beams and two inch x four inch manufactured gussets, unlike other pools that are braced every four or eight feet. In addition to the pressure treated wood braces, a Sun Holiday Pool utilizes an extensive four inch Structural Steel base and top with an angle iron corner support system incorporated within the construction.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<h2>Coping</h2>\n<p>Sun Holiday Pools come with aluminum coping which offers a liner-lock design. This unique design prevents the liner from pulling loose. Unlike other plastic or PVC coping, the aluminum coping is built to last a lifetime.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<h2>Insulation Foam</h2>\n<p>A Sun Holiday Pool sidewall is further insulated with foam insulation serving two purposes: it insulates the pool which makes the pool water warmer, and it protects the liner from the sidewalls. The insulation foam are designed to last for decades.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<h2>Premium Liner</h2>\n<p>Manufactured in the USA from premium quality virgin vinyl, the liner is designed with enough flexibility to fit attractively into a pool, yet strong enough to last for years. All seams and edges are lap welded electronically by a special process, and designs are the result of extensive research and experience.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<h2>Plumbing</h2>\n<p>All fittings are schedule 40-80 products made of durable PVC material.
