You just do not come to our\n                  location and receive an 8x10 glossy of pools and or products.\n                  We will talk to you, ask you what you are looking for & take\n                  our time with you and listen to what either your issues with\n                  your current pool may be or just give you information and help\n                  educate you on your pool operation and or water chemistry. We\n                  will listen to what you are striving to accomplish with a new\n                  pool. We try to make this as stress free as possbile to enable\n                  you to enjoy your pool, family and summer.\n                </p>\n                <p>\n                  You will see videos of US doing the work. You can see the work\n                  being performed. We DESIGN pools for you & not just offer what\n                  our suppliers carry, as many other locations must do. You are\n                  purchasing (in our wood pool line) direct from us, the\n                  manufacturer, which saves you money. We can also deliver water\n                  for your needs. You also will be shown our manufacturing\n                  facility where you will see your pool being manufactured just\n                  for you, not just a \"cookie cutter\" product as many others\n                  offer. This is what sets SUNBURST POOLS above the rest. We\n                  strive to exceed your expectations.\n                </p>\n                <p>\n                  As owner, I take personal interest in you, our clients, for\n                  without you, I know and I will never forget, we have nothing.\n                  Please stop by and talk to me and see what we can do for you.\n                  From new pool builds both in ground, above ground or on\n                  ground, to service or to rehab a pool that you may have felt\n                  was a total loss or just to express your thoughts.
