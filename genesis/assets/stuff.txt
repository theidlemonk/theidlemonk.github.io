Most of us dream of having a small place on a lake or in the woods, somewhere out in the country, a safe
place for privacy and solitude, a place to call home.
For a segment of those individuals, ones who have paid their debts
to society, including a number of proud American Veterans that have been
pre-screened by the Department of Corrections, individuals they feel are
ready to integrate back into society, a safe place to live and work or a
community that would accept them is even harder for them to realize.
Facts show in this great country, there are thousands of homeless
Veterans who need a place to
home who have not been incarcerated,
and yet, live daily within an invisible prison, one without walls and iron
bars, a prison called despair and hopelessness!
Genesis Communities (An Ohio Based Not For Profit Corporation)
has a solution. Our designs of personal cabins, ones that offer a
comfortable and ecological way of living in harmony with local and State
guidelines, sensitive to the NIMBY laws. (Not In My Backyard) gives these
individuals a sense of hope. A place where they feel a sense of community
involvement and have affordable housing, a community that offers jobs and
support by surrounding them with positive thinking, social, faith based and
professional individuals that promotes positive lifestyles to enable the
residents to become welcomed contributors back to society.
