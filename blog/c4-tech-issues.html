          One issue in the tech industry that doesn't get much visibility is that; The firms ignoring or denying to help any developer that works for them in their own development. Don't get me wrong, I am not intending that they let the devs do what they want or this is not a question about sponsorship. It is more on the lines of if the dev knows more he might leave; for another firm, for a better firm.

          Over my tenure in the <em>IT</em> industry, I have come across where the dev teams have individuals with varying skill sets. It could be in different platforms/fields or maybe the same field with different levels. Mostly in relatively bigger firms, I have noticed that the devs with a lower skillset gets stuck with tasteless work. Its not a case of bullying, more like the dev is not trusted to do the actual job (of coding) right. I have seen cases where mentoring was considered to be a waste of a resource and sometimes even a waste of company time(why do that when someone else can finish it in an hour). I have been hungry for leaning new tech, and it motivates me.

          Most times, the devs try to learn / pick up new technology in their off work hours. At times, a dev needs to take sometime off for their own development. At times, because the firm wants to change the technology they have been using, it might need to provide training to their own devs. This is where I've seen a weird approach by many firms. Move to a new technology because it saves on cost, but dont train the existing devs coz that add to the cost and what if they leave. Kinda weird I think. The in-house devs are SMEs for the legacy tools. Doesn't mean a new person cannot pick this up, but a new team! <em>Hmmmm</em>. What if they dont train and they stay.

          There has been may proven working models to the solution to this. Let the devs develop themselves. Encourage them in this process. Outcome is a better team. Now more than one can get the work done quicker. Velocity increases. Better products. Awesome work environment. Now the firm don't need to look for devs, they just keep getting applications as this becomes <em>THE</em> place to work. When these companies understand the difference been the motivation to perform physical and the motivation for mental/challenging tasks, a lot of good could happen. Here is an interesting <a href="http://youtu.be/u6XAPnuFjJc">video</a> about motivation by Dan Pink.
