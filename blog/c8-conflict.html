          Let me tell you about a scene from my life that challenged me in multiple forms. It was one of them simple <em>'lets go out to eat'</em> moments. But this had been building up from before. We would never go to the place I really want. My wants were usually based on the cuisine. And it was the same on the other side as well. So it was never the same or a close alternative to the other.
        </p>

          I dont't really consider a conflict here. It was more like there was no consideration of the other. Maybe that was the conflict. Anyways, we would end up with the choice thats not mine.

          I would get angry but tried my best to enjoy the evening. I'm a foodie, so it was tough. But I couldn't find a good solution to this. So would end up agreeing, because it was more soothening than a ruined evening. So I thought this for a while. And all I came up with was to use my intuition for the days we might have the <em>'lets go out to eat'</em> moment, and I would offer to pick up food.

          It worked in a way, but if I had to go back and change, I would've discussed my feelings about the situation in the nicest way and hope for the best.
