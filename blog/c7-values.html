          I had written about a particular stereotype threat in my earlier blog. But I want to give my way of overcoming most kinds of such behavior. There is not one type of stereotype threat. We have all faced it. And we have played a part in contributing to it as well.

          That said, let me tell you how I kept myself motivated in such times. Yes, I did face the <em>maybe i do suck</em> or <em>may be I am just not cut out for this</em>. Either way, I guess its human tendency, or something in me, but the one thing that keeps me motivated is <em>'Mastery'</em>.

          Let me explain. I told this to someone no a similar topic and I was looked at funny. It was perceived that I am trying to potray myself as highly competitive and genius level. Let me clear the air a little here. With <em>Mastery</em> I did mean being competitive, but not with somebody, instead with myself. I kept trying to get better than me. This kept me motivated. Gave me a purpose. Helped me though most stressful times. Went to a point were bad opinion did not bother me anymore.

          Let me give you an example. This is from when I wanted to learn to play the guitar. When I started taking lessons, I got judged by the brand and type of guitar I was learning on. If I could keep a tempo and so on. It was hard initially. More like an endurance race. Laps and laps and still nothing. But I kept at it. <br> My first take was to get better than me. Memorise them chords. Build muscle memory. Then it was to be able to play without looking at the guitar. My motivation was to get better than me everytime.

          I am not sure if this musing still support the topic of <em>'Affirmation and Stereotype Threat'</em>, but I hope I was able to motivate you just a little bit.<br> Here is a video by Dan Pink taking about what motivates us.
