        <h3><em>Pairing:</em></h3>
<em>What was it like to pair with others to solve challenges?</em><br>
I like the concept of pairing. I have always learnt something new everytime I have paired on anything. 
<br><br><em>Was something particularly fun or rewarding?</em><br>
This was a remote pairing session. I have done very few of them. Everytime, there was a successful communication between the pairs when a mini achievement was gained, it was very rewarding.
<br><br><em>Was something frustrating and difficult for you?</em><br>
Every one I have paired with has their own charm and ways of working with a problem. I think I understand that and it keeps me going.

<h3><em>Feedback:</em></h3>
<em>How did you feel when you read your feedback?</em><br>
Like another good constructive feedback to make me beter than me. It was enlightening to hear from my pair as to what they felt or thought about the time we spent on the challenge.
<br><br><em>Was the feedback you received helpful to your learning?</em><br>
Every feedback has been helpful in their own way. Yes its always helpful.
<br><br><em>Based on the feedback you've received, what are you going to do to improve next time you pair?</em><br>
I think I suck at clear communication while remote pairing. Maybe because I am thinking something else but also trying to keep up with the navigation. Will try to stay more focussed and communicate more clearly.
<br><br><em>How was it to write feedback?</em><br>
Writing feedback was good. I try to be kind and specific as much as I can be. At times it just more like a 'Awesome job' thing, where I am really struggling to think of specifics and stuff, but the pairing seesion overall was just right.
<br><br><em>What was most difficult for you when writing feedback for your pair?</em><br>
I would not call it easy, but it has not been too difficult. But I have struggled with framing the sentence right at times, when one way seemed more kind than the other.
