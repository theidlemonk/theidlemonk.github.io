          One of the stereotypes I have faced myself and see it happen a lot in the dev world is that, somewhat good devs tend to behave differently towards people with less knowlege in technology. I see it happen everyday at work too. Web developers tend to treat normal users as 'Stupid'. Please note, I said somewhat good devs mostly tend to do this. I have seen this behavior less in most well experienced devs. This is not a survey result but purely a personal observation.

          I used the word 'Stupid' here to describe a behavior. I apologies if I offended you reading this, but there is no other better way to describe this. Calling it a condescending behavior won't do much justice. This is not just a developers behavior towards a regular user, but also fellow team-mates who might not work on the same platform.

          I started of as an Oracle Programmer. I know programming and database don't go together. But it is what PLSQL stands for pretty much. In my PLSQL days I would have web developers (C# and Java), look at me funny when I would suggest something. I was actually told by one that they were discussing C# which was totally out of my league, so I need not attend.

          I guess I can say, I have learnt as I have been there. May be I'm crazy, but I'm glad I faced it. Made me a better person as I got into the world of web development. It was an intersting look on their faces when I conducted a training for some of these guys to talk about the MVC framework. Cheers to me. <img class="right" src="http://www.veryicon.com/icon/png/Food%20%26%20Drinks/Real%20Vista%20Food/beer.png">
