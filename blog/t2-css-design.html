          A <em>Class</em> and an <em>id</em> in an HTML tag are basically pointers or hooks to that tag. Now, the usual understanding is they are both related to the styling of the website; so related to the <em>css</em>. When I started using them (just to make them work), I would randomly add a <em>Class</em> or an <em>id</em> to identify a particular element of my HTML that I plan to style in a particular way. It did work for what I was trying to do, but it didn't do a whole lot a good. So code wise, it was cluttered, a <em>Class</em> or an <em>id</em> for every little element on the page.  
        </p>

        <h4 >So how are we to use these hooks!!!</h4>
        <p>
          I had the same question for a while and an attitude like Mr. Stuart Minion as seen here. Lets clear the air a bit first. These hooks are primarily on the html side. These are to point at particular elements on the page. So css does not care if its a <em>Class</em> or an <em>id</em>, as long it finds the element to style. In simpler words, <em>Class's</em> and <em>ids</em> are not just for css.
        </p>
        <p>
          A <em>Class</em> is used when we want to identify multiple of elements on the page for the same style. Whereas an <em>id</em> is used to pin point one unique element on the page.
        </p>

        <h4> Lets look at some examples.</h4>
        <h5>Class Example</h5>
        <p>If we have a button with type 'submit' or a type 'button' and we would want them both to be blue, we would use a <em>Class</em>. There are three different types of declarations for a button having the same <em>'.btn'</em> class associated. So they all get styled the same exact way.
        </p>

        <img class="screenshot" alt="Class example" src="../assets/Class-example.png">

        <h5>ID Example</h5>
        <p>Now in the same example above, say we had to point out the submit button specifically to style it differently. This way we can make it stand out as a form submission button. An id is added to that button declaration. Also in the css a specific style is added to the id as well for it to stand out.
        </p>

        <h4 >Conclusions</h4>
        <p>
          A class is used for grouping similar things. An id is used for identifying unique things.
        </p>

        <p>
          <em>All thats clear, but here's the 'AHA' moment.</em><br>
          The id hook being unique, can also be used to direct a user to a particular part of a page. So if an id hook is used in the url, the browser specifically looks for that hook on the page and scrolls to it automatically. I know cool right. <br>
          So for example, the url <em>'http://getbootstrap.com/css/#buttons'</em> will take you to the getbootstrap.com/css page and then scroll to the part of the page that has the id of buttons. <a href="http://getbootstrap.com/css/#buttons">Click here to try it.</a>
