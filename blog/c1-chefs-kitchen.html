         I think DBC is going to be awesome. I must admit initially I was unsure about this. Shareef did clear a few of my doubts in his video. But I did attend a meet up with the local Columbus DBC group this afternoon, and I am feeling more confident about this now. Glad to be a part of the local Columbus DBC. Looking forward to the upcoming weeks.</p>
