          My be the title of this post is wrong. May be it should be 'Learning Style'. <em>-- changes the title to 'Learning Style' --</em> Or may be I not explaining it right to  myself. <em>-- phone beeps .. checks G+ for updates --</em> I think 'Thinking Style' is a better title for this.  <em>-- changes the title to 'Thinking Style' --</em>

          My mind skips around a lot of things while I'm trying to do things. As per the 'thinking style quiz', I learn better doing than reading. Maybe they are right. May be the program is right. Now I'm curious about their <em>If/Else</em> conditions for the logic behind it. Oh well, another time, I need to write this.

          During college is when I had the realisation that I mostly learn by doing, but reading the 'right stuff' in between does help the velocity of my conception. But that was not it. I would be able to do while learning, but I would take the same amount of time to do it again. Something was missing. I was not understanding it in a simple logical manner. I was getting too much information at the same time, so by mind would only process, rather remember selectively. Not all that bad, it worked but not the way I wanted.

            I learned to swim in 7th grade. I must admit, I had a real good coach. Till date, I can swim efficiently even if i had not done it for a few years. Its like muscle memory, my body knows how to react when I take a dive. I was not getting that kind of conception while learning things.

            So this made me evaluate my situation. In college, I started asking my room-mate, classmates, almost anyone who was willing to listen, if they wanted me to teach them what I had learned. The outcome was awesome. My concepts were much clearer. Things got a lot clear in my mind when I was saying things out loud. So I started doing it for any new thing I would learn. At times I wouldn't find anyone who was willing to listen. That made me improvise. I would talk to the Michael Jordan poster that we had in our room. I didn't really need to talk to a person, I could've just said it out loud to myself. But a reference was good. Let me thank Michael Jordan for being such a good listener. His patience helped me in learning a lot in college.

            Now a days, I explain syntax and code to my dogs at times. I understood ruby arrays and hashes much better after explaining it to my pomapoo. Never thought if this style of learning really was something other people did as well. So did what I know best to find the answer, Googled it, and found a name for this style too. Same context used differenty. <a class="fancy" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rubber_duck_debugging">Rubber Duck Debugging</a>
